# 🏥 Patient Mortality Forecasting Framework

🛠 Tools & Technologies

MS Excel — Data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL (PgAdmin) — Data analysis and KPI extraction

Visualization (Power BI) — Insight presentation

📌 Project Overview

The Patient Mortality Forecasting Framework is a SQL-driven healthcare analytics project focused on identifying critical factors influencing in-hospital patient mortality. The goal of this project is to transform raw clinical data into actionable insights that support early risk detection, operational optimization, and improved patient outcomes.

🎯 Business Objective

Hospitals often struggle to proactively identify high-risk patients during admission and treatment. Delayed interventions, unmanaged comorbidities, and ICU inefficiencies can significantly increase mortality rates.

This project aims to leverage structured data analysis to uncover mortality drivers and provide data-backed insights for clinical decision-making.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Clinical Risk Metrics

Overall Mortality Rate

Mortality Distribution by Age Group

Mortality by Comorbidity Type

Operational Efficiency Metrics

Mortality by ICU Admission Source

Mortality by ICU Type

Mortality by ICU Stay Duration

🔍 Analytical Approach

Cleaned and standardized hospital patient data

Structured datasets into relational SQL tables

Applied aggregations, and conditional logic

Analyzed demographic, clinical, and ICU-related factors

Generated KPI-driven insights to assess mortality risks

📈 Key Insights

Mortality risk increased significantly among elderly patients, particularly those aged 65 and above

Comorbid conditions such as diabetes and immunosuppression showed strong correlation with higher mortality

Longer ICU stays demonstrated increased mortality probability

Emergency admissions contributed to the highest volume of mortality cases

💡 Business Impact

Enables early identification of high-risk patients

Supports proactive clinical interventions

Improves ICU resource planning

Reduces preventable patient mortality

Enhances data-driven healthcare strategies

🚀 Future Enhancements

Incorporate additional clinical indicators such as lab results and medications

Develop predictive models for mortality risk scoring

Integrate real-time monitoring dashboards
