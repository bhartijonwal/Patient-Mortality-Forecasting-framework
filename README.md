📌 Project Overview

The Patient Mortality Forecasting Framework is a SQL-driven healthcare analytics project focused on identifying critical factors influencing in-hospital patient mortality. The goal of this project is to transform raw clinical data into actionable insights that support early risk detection, operational optimization, and improved patient outcomes.

🎯 Business Objective

Hospitals often struggle to proactively identify high-risk patients during admission and treatment. Delayed interventions, unmanaged comorbidities, and ICU inefficiencies can significantly increase mortality rates.

This project aims to leverage structured data analysis to uncover mortality drivers and provide data-backed insights for clinical decision-making.

🔍 Analytical Approach

Cleaned and standardized hospital patient data

Structured datasets into relational SQL tables

Applied aggregations, and conditional logic

Analyzed demographic, clinical, and ICU-related factors

Generated KPI-driven insights to assess mortality risks

📈 Key Insights

Mortality risk increased significantly among elderly patients, particularly those aged 65 and above

Comorbid conditions such as diabetes and immunosuppression showed strong correlation with higher mortality

Longer ICU stays demonstrated increased mortality probability

Emergency admissions contributed to the highest volume of mortality cases

💡 Business Impact
